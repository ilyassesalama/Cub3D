TODO:
- release a ray out of the player to check for walls distance
- rotate the player depending on the directions keys
- if there is no player -> error and exit
- protect empty map file (segfault)

TOFIX:
- skip spaces and tabs after directions keywords
- handle invalid characters expect the config keywords (e.g.: NO ... jj WE ...)
- IMP: setting a short line in the first line of the map, runs the map generator once.
