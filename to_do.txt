TODO:
- release a ray out of the player to check for walls distance
- rotate the player depending on the directions keys
- if there is no player -> error and exit
- protect empty map file (segfault)

TOFIX:
- skip spaces and tabs after directions keywords
- handle invalid characters expect the config keywords (e.g.: NO ... jj WE ...)
- protect WIDTH and HEIGHT != 0
- add macro TILE_SIZE = 32 and replace it in the code

LEAKS:
- Map needs to be freed (optional)
- Textures variables need to be freed
